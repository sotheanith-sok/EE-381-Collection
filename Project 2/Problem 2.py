Problem 2:
You will write a Python program to calculate Bayes‚Äô probabilities.
Consider a rare disease. Let ùê∂ be the probability of having the disease. Let ùêµ be the event that the
diagnostic procedure indicates the disease is present. Consider the following probabilities:
P(C):
    0.0001
    0.001
    0.001
    0.0001  
    0.001
P(B|C):
    0.9
    0.9
    0.9
    0.95
    0.95
P(B|C'):
    0.001
    0.001
    0.01
    0.001
    0.01
P(C|B):?
